	Client supplied a low resolution jpeg of their logo to use in a layout for their New York Stock Exchange
	Podium backdrop banner. The client wasn't totally satisfied with just their logo and company name on a
	blank white backdrop, so they sent a high resolution photo to add. I got a little artistic and designed
	them a full banner and re-created their logo so it would print nice on the backdrop.

	I had to extend the high-res photo more than 120% to the left and bottom and position the building
	so it would place well on the final banner.
