	Hi, my name is Spike Grobstein. I'm a freelance artist, programmer,
	technophile and all-around geek. Currently living in Brooklyn, NY, I work as
	a production artist at flag &amp; banner company and also handle brokering and
	artwork of screen printing orders as well as managing several open source projects
	on the side.

<p>
	I've got 10 years experience in offset printing and digital prepress and 6 years
	experience in screen printing and embroidery. I've been a hobbiest programmer for
	14 years and have dabbled in most popular languages (PERL, C, ObjC, BASIC, PHP, Python,
	Ruby, bash, AppleScript). I'm also an operating system slut and have been known to use
	everything from OSX to Linux to Windows to BeOS and everything in between.
</p>

<p>
	I'm currently available for freelance work; be it design work or software
	development. I'm highly proficient in PERL, C and AppleScript, on the programming end,
	and consider myself to be a full-fledged guru in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
	<a href="/portfolio/" title="Examples of Previous Work">Examples</a> of my work are available as well as a complete
	<a href="/resume/" title="Work History and Skillset">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>. At the moment,
	I'm specializing in design of flyers and automation of repetitive tasks in OSX using AppleScript.
