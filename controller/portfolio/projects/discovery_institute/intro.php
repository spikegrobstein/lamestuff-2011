	I was contracted to do a logo for the Discovery Institute. Being an organization dedicated to helping people
	with addiction disorders, they requested a logo that would be inviting as well as portray an air of friendliness.

	I had complete creative freedom with the design and colors of the logo and after a series of revisions and minor
	tweaks, the logo was eventually approved.
