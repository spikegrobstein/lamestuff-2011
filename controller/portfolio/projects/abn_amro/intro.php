	The project was to create a 10'x20' flag using a photo and ANB-AMRO's colors and logo to advertise the 2006 Volvo Ocean Race.

	After creating a first design, the project changed from a rectangular flag to an angled flag; because of this,
	additional image was needed. Since there was no additional image available, it had to be created with photoshop.
