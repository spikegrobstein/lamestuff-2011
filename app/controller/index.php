	Hi, my name is Spike Grobstein. I'm a freelance artist, programmer,
	technophile and all-around geek. Currently living in Brooklyn, NY, I work as
	a systems administrator at a large record company in the development department
	as well as manage several open source projects on the side.

<p>
	I've got 10 years experience in offset printing and digital prepress and 6 years
	experience in screen printing and embroidery. I've been a hobbyist programmer for
	14 years and have dabbled in most popular languages (PERL, C, ObjC, BASIC, PHP, Python,
	Ruby, bash, AppleScript). I'm also an operating system slut and have been known to use
	everything from OSX to Linux to Windows to BeOS and everything in between.
</p>

<p>
	I'm currently available for freelance work; be it design work or software
	development. I'm highly proficient in PERL, C and AppleScript, on the programming end,
	and am a full-fledged guru (aka Certified Expert) in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

	I'm specializing in design of flyers and automation of repetitive tasks in OSX using AppleScript.
