	For Christmas 2006, I wanted to create cards for my family and friends.
	I started by drawing a nice wintery background and then had to come up with graphics to use as the centerpiece on the card. All graphics were done in Illustrator without the use of any reference graphics except for the sleigh which required some use of Google's image search for perspective and elements.
